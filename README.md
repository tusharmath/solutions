##Problem Statement
Implement a Bill Manager to track bills among friends

Using HTML/CSS/Javascript, create a page to add, edit and delete "n" number of friends and "n" bills list.

We should be able to link a friend to the bill and split the bill equally to the friends added to that bill.

We should be able to view the list of bills and friends.

Optional Items:

In view mode, Filter/Search to find the friends and bills added.

Use local storage to persist the data
Note -
1. Input fields for a bill are given below:
  a) Expense Description
  b) Amount
  c) Friends
2. Object Oriented JS Code would be a plus.
  (For reference, you can go through splitwise.com)

Some basic rules to keep in mind

Code should work in multiple browsers (IE, FF and Chrome).

Use native javascript. No third party libraries are allowed.

Once done with the test, mail us back the files in zip format.

##Approach
1. Event driven, pub sub based design paradigm.
